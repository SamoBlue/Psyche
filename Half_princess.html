            <p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span></strong>This is an early vision of the game, everything is subject to change. The story draws inspiration from real-life stories mostly my story.<br /><br /></span><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">II </span></strong>The game's main attraction is its story. Gameplay is minimal (more like exploration), most of the game is just text-based conversations between two characters or one character and his/her inner thoughts.<br /><br /></span><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>III</strong></span> <span style="color: #ffffff;">The game is designed for two players, in which the screen is split vertically just like the pictures there is a window between them and they have to walk to the windows to be able to talk to each other and solve the puzzles togther.</span></span></p>
