            <p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6464;">Note I </span></strong>This is a video game project not a book nor a blog, this an early vision of the project, everything is subject to change.
            <p><span style="color: #ffffff;"></span><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6464;">Note II </span></strong>The game's main attraction is its story. Gameplay is minimal (more like exploration), most of the game is just text-based conversations between two characters or one character and their inner thoughts.<br /></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #4affa2;">2018 October</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #4affa2;">Sammy has just enrolled in the University of Game Development with a goal to create a game that would 
                positively impact players.But he couldn't finish creating any game as he was lacking in his artistic style. Determined to find a 
                friend who excelled in drawing, he went to the Game Design department.<br /><br />Despite of his efforts, he couldn't find any students interested in drawing in the style he envisioned. Most of them were focused on 3D realistic and rounded-edge drawings. So he gave up and planned to just hire an online artist. So he headed twoards his car to head to his home and in there in the front seat was 
                <button class="spoiler-button1" onclick="toggleSpoiler1()">M𝓎̶̴̠𝓇̶̸͍𝓉̶̵̞𝓁̶̴̙ℯ̶̵̺</button>  waitting for

So what do you think ?<br /></span><span style="color: #cc99ff;"><span style="color: #ffff99;">S:</span> (took him a second) Wait, you drew that?! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's amazing, I love it. Since when can you draw? <br /></span><span style="color: #cc99ff;"><span style="color: #ffff99;">M:</span> I watched some videos online but do you really like it<br /><span style="color: #ffff99;">S: </span>Yes yes It's really nice ... I'm just suprised<br /><span style="color: #ffff99;">M:</span> I know i still have a long way to go but i just want to help you on that game you working on<br /><span style="color: #ffff99;">S: </span>M𝓎̶̴̠𝓇̶̸͍𝓉̶̵̞𝓁̶̴̙ℯ̶̵̺&nbsp; you don't have to do this i can--<br /><span style="color: #ffff99;">M:</span> Stop, you help me a lot and this is the least i can do<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;   but in one condtion you let me put 3 things i want in your game</span></p>
