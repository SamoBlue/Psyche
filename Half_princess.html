            <p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6464;">Note I </span></strong>This is a video game project not a book nor a blog, this an early vision of the project, everything is subject to change.
            <p><span style="color: #ffffff;"></span><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6464;">Note II </span></strong>The game's main attraction is its story. Gameplay is minimal (more like exploration), most of the game is just text-based conversations between two characters or one character and their inner thoughts.<br /></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #4affa2;">2018 October</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #4affa2;">Sammy has just enrolled in the University of Game Development with a goal to create a game that would positively impact players.But he couldn't finish creating any game as he was lacking in his artistic style. Determined to find a friend who excelled in drawing, he went to the Game Design department.<br /><br />Despite of his efforts, he couldn't find any students interested in drawing in the style he envisioned. Most of them were focused on 3D realistic and rounded-edge drawings. So he gave up and planned to just hire an online artist. So he headed twoards his car to head to his home and in there in the front seat was M waitting for him as she was holding a tablet with both of her hands and her eyes full of excitement said "Sammy Sammy i have something to show you" and she flipped her tablet <button class="spoiler-button" onclick="toggleSpoiler()">The Most Beautiful Drawing I've Seen</button>            </span>
