            This is a video game project not a book nor a blog, this an early
            vision of the project, everything is subject to change.

            ><strong><span style="color: #ff6464">Note II </span></strong>The
            game's main attraction is its story. Gameplay is minimal (more like
            exploration), most of the game is just text-based conversations
            between two characters or one character and their inner thoughts.<br

        >Sammy has just enrolled in the University of Game Development with a goal to
        create a game that would positively impact players.But he couldn't finish
        creating any game as he was lacking in his artistic style. Determined to find
        a friend who excelled in drawing, he went to the Game Design department.<br /><br />Despite
        of his efforts, he couldn't find any students interested in drawing in the
        style he envisioned. Most of them were focused on 3D realistic and
        rounded-edge drawings. So he gave up and planned to just hire an online
        artist. So he headed twoards his car to head to his home and in there in the
        front seat was
